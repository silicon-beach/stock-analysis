# Stock Technical Analysis

#### Setup

Few points to remember

* If possible use the git branching model according to [this](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)
  * There is a [git plugin](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) for the same.
  * It is important that we branch from the branch develop (always), not doing so could cause merge conflicts.
  * Only tested code would be pushed to master.
  * When merging features to develop please create a pull request and then merge. This will help us in roling back the changes.
* For first time git users, please use a git GUI like sourcetree.
